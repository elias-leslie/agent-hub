Audit and fix ALL tests across ALL projects (agent-hub, summitflow, portfolio-ai, terminal, monkey-fight) to ensure they properly mock LLM adapters and never make real API calls.

Context: Tests were making real LLM calls, creating sessions in agent-hub, and consuming tokens. We added X-Source-Client: pytest headers to track/block test traffic, but blocking causes tests to fail because they're making real calls instead of using mocks.

Goal: After this audit, ALL tests must pass even when:
1. The 'pytest' client is blocked in Agent Hub Admin UI
2. Network connectivity is disabled
3. No API keys are configured

Read the full audit plan: ~/agent-hub/tasks/test-adapter-mocking-audit.md

Start with agent-hub (the source of adapters), then summitflow, portfolio-ai, terminal, and monkey-fight.

For each project:
1. Find all test files
2. Identify tests that import or call adapters/AgentHubClient without mocking
3. Fix each test to use proper mocks
4. Verify by running tests with network blocked or pytest client disabled

Create reusable mock fixtures in each project's tests/conftest.py.
